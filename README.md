# cub3D
Cub3D is a simple 3D game engine project inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It uses raycasting to render a 3D environment from a 2D map and includes basic game mechanics like player movement, textures, and interaction with the environment.
